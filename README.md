# liberty tree

If information seeks to be free, so too should the platforms that allow for the construction of that information into knowledge. In order to balance the playingfield, we must eliminate the ability to make money in a space. If financial incentive to operation within a space is collapsed, it enables new and more vibrant markets to exist.

For this reason, liberty tree seeks to:

Create a platform that aids in the deployment of elmsln's fractal architecture on any hosting provider or server. What we'll require:
* username / password or key file to connect to sever
* your authorization to allow the system to deploy itself
* establishing the host as a new member of the network
* support for multiple addresses and defining which services live where

Think digital ocean style deployment but without the need to host there. Vagrant / puphpet.com style setup form that actually can deploy against your own hardware. This eliminates the need for vendors in this space to simply install and manage servers that live in the cloud or inside the walled garden.

The tree of liberty was once a ralying point for the american revolution, a large elm tree. We too seek to produce such a beacon, that might inspire the deployment of endlessly dense groves of elms trees. Our liberty tree is not rooted in the physical form though, and as such can be a self replicating beacon for those that fork this repository and deploy the open ulmus architecture on their own hosting. This will provide multiple portals for people to deploy from, a fractual liberty tree that will inspire a revolution in education if we allow it to.

We don't need to be controlled, we don't need SaaS, we don't need faceless boardrooms telling educators how to teach. What we need, is liberty, freedom, control, flexibility and total independence.
